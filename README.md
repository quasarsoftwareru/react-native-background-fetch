------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background Fetch is a *very* simple plugin which will awaken an app in the background about **every 15 minutes**, providing a short period of background running-time.  This plugin will execute your provided `callbackFn` whenever a background-fetch event occurs.

There is **no way** to increase the rate which a fetch-event occurs and this plugin sets the rate to the most frequent possible &mdash; you will **never** receive an event faster than **15 minutes**.  The operating-system will automatically throttle the rate the background-fetch events occur based upon usage patterns.  Eg: if user hasn't turned on their phone for a long period of time, fetch events will occur less frequently.

The Android plugin provides a [HeadlessJS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html) implementation allowing you to continue handling events even after app-termination (see **[`@config enableHeadless`](#config-boolean-enableheadless-false)**)

## Installing the plugin

### With `yarn`

```bash
$ yarn add react-native-background-fetch
```

### With `npm`
```bash
$ npm install --save react-native-background-fetch
```

## Example ##

```javascript

import BackgroundFetch from "react-native-background-fetch";

export default class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Configure it.
    BackgroundFetch.configure({
      minimumFetchInterval: 15,     // <-- minutes (15 is minimum allowed)
      // Android options
      stopOnTerminate: false,
      startOnBoot: true,
      requiredNetworkType: BackgroundFetch.NETWORK_TYPE_NONE, // Default
      requiresCharging: false,      // Default
      requiresDeviceIdle: false,    // Default
      requiresBatteryNotLow: false, // Default
      requiresStorageNotLow: false  // Default
    }, () => {
      console.log("[js] Received background-fetch event");
      // Required: Signal completion of your task to native code
      // If you fail to do this, the OS can terminate your app
      // or assign battery-blame for consuming too much background-time
      BackgroundFetch.finish(BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_NEW_DATA);
    }, (error) => {
      console.log("[js] RNBackgroundFetch failed to start");
    });

    // Optional: Query the authorization status.
    BackgroundFetch.status((status) => {
      switch(status) {
        case BackgroundFetch.STATUS_RESTRICTED:
          console.log("BackgroundFetch restricted");
          break;
        case BackgroundFetch.STATUS_DENIED:
          console.log("BackgroundFetch denied");
          break;
        case BackgroundFetch.STATUS_AVAILABLE:
          console.log("BackgroundFetch is enabled");
          break;
      }
    });
  }
};
```

## Config

### Common Options

#### `@param {Integer} minimumFetchInterval [15]`

The minimum interval in **minutes** to execute background fetch events.  Defaults to **`15`** minutes.  **Note**:  Background-fetch events will **never** occur at a frequency higher than **every 15 minutes**.  Apple uses a secret algorithm to adjust the frequency of fetch events, presumably based upon usage patterns of the app.  Fetch events *can* occur less often than your configured `minimumFetchInterval`.

### Android Options

#### `@config {Boolean} stopOnTerminate [true]`

Set `false` to continue background-fetch events after user terminates the app.  Default to `true`.

#### `@config {Boolean} startOnBoot [false]`

Set `true` to initiate background-fetch events when the device is rebooted.  Defaults to `false`.

:exclamation: **NOTE:** `startOnBoot` requires `stopOnTerminate: false`.

#### `@config {Boolean} forceReload [false]`

Set `true` to automatically relaunch the application (if it was terminated) &mdash; the application will launch to the foreground then immediately minimize.  Defaults to `false`.

#### `@config {Boolean} enableHeadless [false]`

Set `true` to enable React Native's [Headless JS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html) mechanism, for handling fetch events after app termination.

#### `@config {integer} requiredNetworkType [BackgroundFetch.NETWORK_TYPE_NONE]`

Set basic description of the kind of network your job requires.

If your job doesn't need a network connection, you don't need use this options as the default value is `BackgroundFetch.NETWORK_TYPE_NONE`.

| NetworkType                           | Description                                                         |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BackgroundFetch.NETWORK_TYPE_NONE`     | This job doesn't care about network constraints, either any or none.|
| `BackgroundFetch.NETWORK_TYPE_ANY`      | This job requires network connectivity.                             |
| `BackgroundFetch.NETWORK_TYPE_CELLULAR` | This job requires network connectivity that is a cellular network.  |
| `BackgroundFetch.NETWORK_TYPE_UNMETERED` | This job requires network connectivity that is unmetered.          |
| `BackgroundFetch.NETWORK_TYPE_NOT_ROAMING` | This job requires network connectivity that is not roaming.      |

#### `@config {Boolean} requiresBatteryNotLow [false]`

Specify that to run this job, the device's battery level must not be low.

This defaults to false. If true, the job will only run when the battery level is not low, which is generally the point where the user is given a "low battery" warning.

#### `@config {Boolean} requiresStorageNotLow [false]`

Specify that to run this job, the device's available storage must not be low.

This defaults to false. If true, the job will only run when the device is not in a low storage state, which is generally the point where the user is given a "low storage" warning.

#### `@config {Boolean} requiresCharging [false]`

Specify that to run this job, the device must be charging (or be a non-battery-powered device connected to permanent power, such as Android TV devices). This defaults to false.

#### `@config {Boolean} requiresDeviceIdle [false]`

When set true, ensure that this job will not run if the device is in active use.

The default state is false: that is, the for the job to be runnable even when someone is interacting with the device.

This state is a loose definition provided by the system. In general, it means that the device is not currently being used interactively, and has not been in use for some time. As such, it is a good time to perform resource heavy jobs. Bear in mind that battery usage will still be attributed to your application, and surfaced to the user in battery stats.

* :open_file_folder: **`index.js`**
```javascript
import BackgroundFetch from "react-native-background-fetch";

let MyHeadlessTask = async () => {
  console.log('[BackgroundFetch HeadlessTask] start');

  // Perform an example HTTP request.
  // Important:  await asychronous tasks when using HeadlessJS.
  let response = await fetch('https://facebook.github.io/react-native/movies.json');
  let responseJson = await response.json();
  console.log('[BackgroundFetch HeadlessTask response: ', responseJson);

  // Required:  Signal to native code that your task is complete.
  // If you don't do this, your app could be terminated and/or assigned
  // battery-blame for consuming too much time in background.
  BackgroundFetch.finish();
}

// Register your BackgroundFetch HeadlessTask
BackgroundFetch.registerHeadlessTask(MyHeadlessTask);
```


## Methods

| Method Name | Arguments | Notes
|---|---|---|
| `configure` | `{config}`, `callbackFn`, `failureFn` | Configures the plugin's fetch `callbackFn`.  This callback will fire each time an iOS background-fetch event occurs (typically every 15 min).  The `failureFn` will be called if the device doesn't support background-fetch. |
| `status` | `callbackFn` | Your callback will be executed with the current `status (Integer)` `0: Restricted`, `1: Denied`, `2: Available`.  These constants are defined as `BackgroundFetch.STATUS_RESTRICTED`, `BackgroundFetch.STATUS_DENIED`, `BackgroundFetch.STATUS_AVAILABLE` (**NOTE:** Android will always return `STATUS_AVAILABLE`)|
| `finish` | `fetchResult` | Valid values for `fetchResult (Integer)` include `BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_NEW_DATA` (0), `BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_NO_DATA` (1), and `BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_FAILED` (2).  You **MUST** call this method in your fetch `callbackFn` provided to `#configure` in order to signal to iOS that your fetch action is complete.  iOS provides **only** 30s of background-time for a fetch-event -- if you exceed this 30s, iOS will kill your app. |
| `start` | `successFn`, `failureFn` | Start the background-fetch API.  Your `callbackFn` provided to `#configure` will be executed each time a background-fetch event occurs.  **NOTE** the `#configure` method *automatically* calls `#start`.  You do **not** have to call this method after you `#configure` the plugin |
| `stop` | `successFn`, `failureFn` | Stop the background-fetch API from firing fetch events.  Your `callbackFn` provided to `#configure` will no longer be executed. |



## Debugging

### iOS

- Simulate background fetch events in XCode using **`Debug->Simulate Background Fetch`**
- iOS can take some hours or even days to start a consistently scheduling background-fetch events since iOS schedules fetch events based upon the user's patterns of activity.  If *Simulate Background Fetch* works, your can be **sure** that everything is working fine.  You just need to wait.

### Android

- Observe plugin logs in `$ adb logcat`:
```bash
$ adb logcat *:S ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V TSBackgroundFetch:V
```
- Simulate a background-fetch event on a device (insert *&lt;your.application.id&gt;*) (only works for sdk `21+`:
```bash
$ adb shell cmd jobscheduler run -f <your.application.id> 999
```
- For devices with sdk `<21`, simulate a "Headless JS" event with (insert *&lt;your.application.id&gt;*)
```bash
$ adb shell am broadcast -a <your.application.id>.event.BACKGROUND_FETCH

```

## Implementation

### iOS

Implements [performFetchWithCompletionHandler](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:), firing a custom event subscribed-to in cordova plugin.

### Android

Android implements background fetch using two different mechanisms, depending on the Android SDK version.  Where the SDK version is `>= LOLLIPOP`, the new [`JobScheduler`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobScheduler.html) API is used.  Otherwise, the old [`AlarmManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html) will be used.

Unlike iOS, the Android implementation *can* continue to operate after application terminate (`stopOnTerminate: false`) or device reboot (`startOnBoot: true`).
